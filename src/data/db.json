Some two dozen lines were built in 760 mm (2 ft 5\n+\n15⁄16 in) gauge, a few in 1,000 mm (3 ft 3\n+\n3⁄8 in) metre gauge gauge. The first was the Steyrtalbahn. Others were built by provincial governments, some lines are still in common carrier use and a number of others are preservation projects. The tramway network in Innsbruck is also metre gauge; in Linz the rather unusual gauge of 900 mm (2 ft 11\n+\n7⁄16 in) is in use."
