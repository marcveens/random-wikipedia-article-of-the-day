    "summary": "Shozin Fukui (福居ショウジン, Fukui Shōjin) is a Japanese film director and screenwriter. He has produced three experimental shorts (Metal Days, Gerorisuto, and Caterpillar) and two full-length films (964 Pinocchio, and Rubber's Lover). These movies (excluding Metal Days) were widely available, having been issued on DVD by Unearthed Films. However, these releases have since gone out of print. He has released four more films since then (Onne, Den-Sen, The Hiding and S-94).[1][2] These are almost completely unknown outside Japan."
