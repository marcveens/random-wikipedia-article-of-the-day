    "summary": "An ink eraser is an instrument used to scrape away or chemically bleach ink from a writing surface. This is a more involved process than removing pencil markings. Pencil marks can be gradually adhered to natural rubber fragments by rubbing the mark with a pencil eraser (this action is what prompted Joseph Priestley to give solidified latex its common name.) Ink, however readily penetrates the fibers of most papers and is therefore more difficult to extract by mechanical action."
